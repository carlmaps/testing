# To personalise our recommendations more, I am going to build an engine that computes similarity between
# movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie that a user liked.
# Since we will be using movie metadata (or content) to build this engine, this also known as Content Based Filtering.

# I will build two Content Based Recommenders based on:
# genre
